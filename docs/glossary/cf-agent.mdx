An Agent in ControlFlow is an autonomous entity designed to execute tasks within a workflow. Agents leverage the capabilities of LLMs to perform various functions, such as generating text, answering questions, and interacting with users. Each agent can be tailored with specific instructions, tools, and models to handle distinct roles or domains effectively.

Agents are fundamental to the ControlFlow framework, enabling the execution of tasks according to the defined objectives and context. They operate independently, using the provided instructions to achieve the desired outcomes. Agents can also interact with each other and with human users when necessary, making them versatile components in creating sophisticated and dynamic AI-powered workflows.

By assigning appropriate agents to tasks, developers can ensure that each task is handled by the most suitable entity, optimizing the overall performance and efficiency of the workflow. ControlFlow's agent-based architecture allows for seamless integration of AI capabilities into traditional software workflows, providing a robust and scalable solution for complex application logic.
