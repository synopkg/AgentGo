Dependencies in ControlFlow refer to the relationships between tasks that dictate the order and conditions under which tasks are executed. They ensure that tasks are completed in a logical sequence, where one taskâ€™s output may be required as input for another, or certain tasks must be completed before others can begin.

There are several types of dependencies in ControlFlow:

- Sequential dependencies: One task must be completed before another can start.
- Context dependencies: The result of one task is used as input for another.
- Subtask dependencies: A task consists of multiple subtasks that must be completed before the parent task is considered done.

Dependencies help in managing complex workflows by defining clear relationships and execution order among tasks. By specifying dependencies, developers can create structured and efficient workflows that ensure the correct flow of data and completion of tasks, thereby enhancing the reliability and maintainability of AI-powered applications.
