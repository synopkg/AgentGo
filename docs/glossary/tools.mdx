Tools in ControlFlow are specialized functions or resources that agents can use to accomplish specific tasks within a workflow. They provide the agents with additional capabilities beyond their inherent natural language processing abilities, enabling them to perform more complex and varied operations.

Tools can include Python functions, APIs, libraries, or any resource that an agent might need to fulfill a taskâ€™s requirements. For instance, a tool might be a function to fetch data from a database, process and analyze data, interact with external services, or perform calculations.

By equipping agents with the appropriate tools, developers can enhance the functionality and efficiency of their workflows, ensuring that agents can effectively complete tasks that require specialized knowledge or operations. Tools are defined and associated with tasks or agents, and they enable a modular and extensible approach to building AI-powered workflows in ControlFlow.
