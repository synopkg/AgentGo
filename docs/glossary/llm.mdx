title: Large language models

A Large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Based on deep learning architectures such as Transformer models, LLMs capture complex patterns and relationships within the training data. Their extensive size, often containing billions of parameters, enables them to develop a deep understanding of language and acquire a broad range of knowledge.

LLMs excel in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, language translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Their ability to generate contextually relevant and meaningful responses makes them valuable for applications like chatbots, content creation, and language-based interfaces. LLMs are trained using self-supervised learning techniques, predicting the next word or sequence of words in a given context. This exposure to diverse text data allows them to grasp the intricacies of language, including grammar, syntax, semantics, and world knowledge, enabling them to produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

More than just generating text, LLMs encode knowledge that can be used to produce a variety of non-algorithmic outputs, including using tools, writing code, generating images, and creating music. LLMs can also be [fine-tuned](/glossary/fine-tuning) on specific tasks or domains to improve performance on targeted applications.

However, LLMs have limitations. They can generate biased or factually incorrect outputs based on biases in their training data. They may struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning, common sense understanding, or domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, the training and deployment of large-scale LLMs can be computationally intensive and resource-demanding. Despite these challenges, LLMs remain powerful tools for building sophisticated language-based applications.
