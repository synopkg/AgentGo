In the context of workflow orchestration, a flow represents the overall sequence or arrangement of tasks that make up a complete workflow. A flow defines the logical structure and order in which tasks should be executed to achieve a specific goal or outcome. It encapsulates the dependencies, control flow, and data flow between tasks. 

Orchestration frameworks use the flow definition to coordinate the execution of tasks, handle data passing between them, and manage the overall lifecycle of the workflow. Flows can be designed to handle complex scenarios, including conditional branching, parallel execution, and error handling.
