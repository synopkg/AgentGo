In the context of workflow orchestration, a task represents a single unit of work or a specific step within a larger workflow. Tasks are the building blocks of workflows and encapsulate discrete actions or operations that need to be performed. Each task typically has input parameters, execution logic, and produces an output or result.

Tasks can have upstream dependencies on other tasks, meaning they may require the completion of certain tasks before they can start executing. These dependencies define the order and relationship between tasks within a workflow, as well as move data between tasks. Parent/child dependencies help organize execution by nesting tasks within other tasks.
