A workflow is a sequence of interconnected tasks or steps that represent a specific business process or operation. In the context of orchestration, a workflow defines the order and dependencies of these tasks, ensuring that they are executed in a coordinated and efficient manner.

Workflows are commonly used in complex systems to automate and streamline processes, such as data processing, application deployment, or service orchestration. They provide a high-level view of the entire process, allowing developers and operators to define, manage, and monitor the execution of tasks.

In an orchestration system, a workflow typically consists of multiple activities, each representing a specific task or operation. These activities can be executed sequentially, in parallel, or based on certain conditions, enabling the system to handle complex scenarios and adapt to changing requirements.

Note that an [agentic workflow](/glossary/agentic-workflow) is a specific type of workflow that leverages AI agents to perform tasks and make decisions within the process. By combining human and machine intelligence, agentic workflows can automate repetitive tasks, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making in various domains.
