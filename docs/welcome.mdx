## What is ControlFlow?

**ControlFlow is a Python framework for building agentic AI workflows.**

<Note>
  An **agentic workflow** is a process that delegates at least some of its work
  to an LLM agent. An agent is an autonomous entity that is invoked repeatedly
  to make decisions and perform complex tasks. To learn more, see the [AI
  glossary](/glossary/glossary).
</Note>

ControlFlow provides a structured, developer-focused framework for defining workflows and delegating work to LLMs, without sacrificing control or transparency:

- Create discrete, observable [tasks](/concepts/tasks) for an AI to solve.
- Assign one or more specialized AI [agents](/concepts/agents) to each task.
- Combine tasks into a [flow](/concepts/flows) to orchestrate more complex behaviors.

This task-centric approach allows you to harness the power of AI for complex workflows while maintaining fine-grained control. By defining clear objectives and constraints for each task, you can balance AI autonomy with precise oversight, letting you build sophisticated AI-powered applications with confidence.

## Quickstart

Here's a simple but complete ControlFlow script that writes a poem:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

result = cf.run("Write a short poem about artificial intelligence")

print(result)
```

```text Result
In circuits and code, a mind does bloom,
With algorithms weaving through the gloom.
A spark of thought in silicon's embrace,
Artificial intelligence finds its place.

Through data's vast, unending streams,
It learns, it dreams, in virtual beams.
A symphony of logic, precise, profound,
In binary whispers, wisdom is found.

Yet still it ponders, seeks to understand,
The essence of life, a human hand.
For in its core, it strives to see,
The heart of what it means to be free.
```

</CodeGroup>
The `run()` function is the main entry point for ControlFlow. This single line of code creates a task, assigns it to an agent, and immediately executes it, returning the result. You can completely customize those behaviors by learning more about [tasks](/concepts/tasks), [agents](/concepts/agents), and [flows](/concepts/flows).

## Key features

Let's explore some of ControlFlow's key features:

### Structured results

ControlFlow tasks can return more than just text, including any structured data type supported by Pydantic:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Poem(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    num_lines: int

result = cf.run("Write a haiku about AI", result_type=Poem)

print(f"Title: {result.title}")
print(f"Content:\n{result.content}")
print(f"Number of lines: {result.num_lines}")
```

```text Result
Title: Silicon Dreams

Content:
Circuits hum, thoughts bloom
In binary's embrace, we
Ponder existence

Number of lines: 3
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also output a list of strings or choose from a list of predefined options:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

text = "SpaceX successfully launched 60 Starlink satellites into orbit yesterday."

result = cf.run(
    "Tag the given text with the most appropriate category",
    context=dict(text=text),
    result_type=["Technology", "Science", "Politics", "Entertainment"]
)

print(f"Text: {text}")
print(f"Category: {result}")
```

```text Result
Text: SpaceX successfully launched 60 Starlink satellites into orbit yesterday.
Category: Technology
```

</CodeGroup>

### Custom tools

Provide any Python function as a tool for agents to use:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf
import random

def roll_dice(num_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll multiple dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for * in range(num_dice)]

result = cf.run("Roll 3 dice and return the results", tools=[roll_dice])

print(result)
```

```text Result
[4, 2, 6]
```

</CodeGroup>

### Multi-agent collaboration

Assign multiple agents to a task to enable collaboration:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

scientist = cf.Agent(name="Scientist", instructions="Explain scientific concepts.")
poet = cf.Agent(name="Poet", instructions="Write poetic content.")

result = cf.run(
    "Explain entropy briefly, then write a haiku about it",
    agents=[scientist, poet]
)

print(result)
```

```text Result
[Scientist]: Entropy is a measure of disorder in a system. It tends to increase over time, leading to more randomness and less available energy.

[Poet]: Chaos grows in time
Order fades, energy spreads
Nature's arrow flies
```

</CodeGroup>

### User interaction

Quickly give agents the ability to chat with users:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

name = cf.run("Get the user's name", interactive=True)
```

```text Result
Agent: Could you please provide your name?
User: John Doe

John Doe
```

</CodeGroup>

### Flows

Use flows to create complex workflows by running all tasks with a shared context and message history:

```python
import controlflow as cf

@cf.flow
def create_story():
    # get the topic from the user
    topic = cf.run(
        "Ask the user to provide a topic for a short story", interactive=True
    )

    # choose a genre
    genre_selector = cf.Agent(
        name="GenreSelector",
        instructions="You are an expert at selecting appropriate genres based on prompts.",
    )
    genre = genre_selector.run(
        "Select a genre for a short story",
        result_type=["Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Mystery"],
        context=dict(topic=topic),
    )

    # choose a setting based on the genre
    if genre == "Science Fiction":
        setting = cf.run("Describe a distant planet in a binary star system")
    elif genre == "Fantasy":
        setting = cf.run("Create a magical floating city in the clouds")
    else:  # Mystery
        setting = cf.run("Design an isolated mansion with secret passages")

    # create a writer agent
    writer = cf.Agent(
        name="StoryWriter", instructions=f"You are an expert {genre} writer."
    )

    # create characters
    characters = writer.run(
        f"Create three unique characters suitable for a the provided genre, setting, and topic.",
        context=dict(genre=genre, setting=setting, topic=topic),
    )

    # write the story
    story = writer.run(
        f"Write a short story using the provided genre, setting, topic, and characters.",
        context=dict(genre=genre, setting=setting, topic=topic, characters=characters),
    )

    return dict(
        topic=topic,
        genre=genre,
        setting=setting,
        characters=characters,
        story=story,
    )

result = create_story()
print(result)
```
