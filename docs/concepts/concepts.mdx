ControlFlow is a framework for building AI workflows that bridges the gap between 
structured programming and the natural language capabilities of LLMs. It 
accomplishes this through three core concepts: Tasks, Agents, and Flows.

To create an agentic workflow, you define clear objectives (Tasks), assign 
intelligent entities to accomplish them (Agents), and orchestrate their 
interactions over time (Flows). This approach allows you to harness the power 
of AI while maintaining fine-grained control over your applications.

## ðŸ“‹ Tasks

Tasks represent the structured side of ControlFlow. They are specific, 
well-defined objectives that form the backbone of your workflow. Tasks 
encapsulate the "what" and "how" of your AI-driven operations, providing a 
clear, programmatic structure.

Key features of Tasks:
- Define specific objectives for AI to accomplish
- Specify expected result types and validation criteria
- Can include instructions, context, and tools for execution
- Serve as checkpoints in your workflow

## ðŸ¦¾ Agents

Agents embody the unstructured, natural language side of ControlFlow. They are 
AI-powered entities capable of understanding and generating human-like text,
bringing flexibility and adaptability to your workflows.

Key features of Agents:
- Represent configurable AI entities with their own identity and capabilities
- Can be specialized for specific tasks or have access to different tools
- Collaborate to complete tasks according to provided instructions
- Can be interactive, allowing communication with users
- Allow configuration of different LLM models to power their responses

Agents can be configured with different LLM models, enabling you to choose the 
most suitable model for your needs based on factors such as performance, 
latency, and cost.

## ðŸ§© Flows

Flows provide a shared context for all tasks and agents within a workflow. They 
orchestrate the execution of tasks and the interaction of agents, allowing you 
to create complex, adaptive AI workflows.

Key features of Flows:
- Act as high-level containers for entire AI-powered workflows
- Maintain consistent state and history across all components
- Provide shared context for tasks and agents
- Can be nested to create hierarchical workflows

Learn more in the [Flows](/concepts/flows) section.

## Putting it all together

In a typical ControlFlow application:

1. You define a Flow to represent your overall workflow
2. Within the Flow, you create Tasks to represent specific objectives
3. You assign Agents to work on these Tasks
4. The Flow orchestrates the execution of Tasks and the interaction of Agents

This structure allows you to create powerful, flexible AI workflows while 
maintaining control over the process and ensuring that outputs align with your 
application's requirements.
