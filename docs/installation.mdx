<Warning>
ControlFlow is under active development. You should pin to a specific version if you want to avoid breaking changes. However, we recommend frequent updates to get new features and bug fixes.
</Warning>

## Install ControlFlow

You can install ControlFlow with `pip`:

```bash
pip install controlflow 
```

## Provide an API key

### OpenAI

ControlFlow's default LLM is OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which provides excellent performance out of the box. To use it, you'll need to provide an API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Anthropic

To use an Anthropic model, provide an API key as an environment variable and change the default LLM, like this:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export CONTROLFLOW_LLM_MODEL="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
```

### Other providers

ControlFlow supports many other LLM providers as well, though you'll need to install their respective packages and configure the default LLM appropriately. See the [LLM documentation](/guides/configure-llms) for more information.
